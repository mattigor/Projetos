  <h1>First Movie:</h1>
  <p>Shrek&copy; is an anti-social and highly-territorial green ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp. His life is interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc unknowingly exiles a vast number of fairy-tale creatures to Shrek&copy;'s swamp. Angered by the intrusion, he decides to visit Farquaad and demand they be moved elsewhere. He reluctantly allows the talkative Donkey, who was exiled as well, to tag along and guide him to Duloc.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Farquaad is presented with Snow White's Magic Mirror, who tells him that in order to become a true king, he must marry a princess. Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament, in which the winner will receive the privilege of rescuing Fiona. Shrek&copy; and Donkey arrive during the tournament and defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them champions and demands that they rescue Fiona. Farquaad negotiates to have the fairytale creatures relocated if Shrek&copy; succeeds, and he accepts.</p>

  <p>Shrek&copy; and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by Dragon. Shrek&copy; locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of romanticism. They flee the castle after rescuing Donkey, but when Shrek&copy; removes his helmet revealing he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc demanding Farquaad arrive in person; Shrek&copy; carries her against her will. That night, after setting up camp and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek&copy; confides in Donkey about his frustration with being feared and rejected by others over his appearance. Fiona overhears and decides to be kind to Shrek&copy;. The next day, they encounter Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, and Fiona dispatches them easily with martial arts when they attack. Shrek&copy; is impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.</p>

  <p>When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey later enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains she has been cursed since childhood, forced to transform every night after sunset and changing back at sunrise. She tells Donkey that only "true love's kiss" will break the spell and change her to "love's true form". Meanwhile, Shrek&copy; is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears the conversation as she is calling herself an "ugly beast". Believing that Fiona is talking about him, Shrek&copy; angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Lord Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek&copy;'s abrupt hostility toward her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. Shrek&copy; abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, but realizes that despite his privacy, he feels miserable and misses Fiona.</p>

  <p>Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts Shrek&copy;. During their quarrel, Donkey explains that the "ugly beast" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and urges him to express his feelings for Fiona before she marries, and the two quickly travel to Duloc thanks to Dragon who Donkey had befriended earlier.</p>

  <p>Shrek&copy; interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony completes and tells Fiona that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek&copy; to understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek&copy; executed and Fiona detained. Dragon, alongside Donkey, bursts in and devours Farquaad. Shrek&copy; and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, but permanently making her an ogress, the form that she wasn't expecting, but Shrek&copy; still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with fairy-tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.</p>
